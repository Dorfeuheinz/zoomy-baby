# zoomy-baby
To use the project first you will hav to create a disocrd bot, (I will not be covering how to do that, go watch some tutorials)
Next you need to add your discord bot to the discord guild/server you want to recieve the links from.
Once thats done and your bot is a discord guild member, follow the below listed steps and you are good to go-


Create your personal zoomy-baby by first clone it into a directory in your machine -
`git clone <link>`
(replace `<link>` with the actual git/ssh link of this repo) OR download the zip file and extract it

To build the repo on your local machine, cd into the downloaded folder and type-
`npm install`

To start the local server type-
`npm start`
